        1.4 - Risks on Digital Projects</p>  
    <p>
        In any type of project management, risk is the likelihood of something not going according to plan. As with most aspects of business, digital projects rarely happen under ideal circumstances. They can require a broad convergence of people, systems and data. Despite your best efforts, it’s not always possible to have ironclad answers to every question from the outset. And even if you do, things can change in a heartbeat.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Some examples of risk in a digital project:</strong>
        <br>
        You begin a 6-month long website build project. Two months in, Apple releases a new version of iOS, and the site you have in development doesn’t work properly on the new iOS version.
        <br>
        Halfway through a project, your company merges with another company, which has a very different go-to-market strategy.
        <br>
        Three months into a website build project, a competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that could draw your customers away.
        <br>
        A key team member departs your company for another opportunity mid-way through the project.
        <br>
        Hardware failures at crucial periods / slow connections with deadlines / end date approaching.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Expect the unexpected</strong>
        <br>
        In the digital world, the landscape can change quickly and unexpectedly. When the planning process recognizes the potential for change and allows for contingency planning, the probability of project success increases dramatically. Risk mitigation needs to be a key part of all project planning efforts and is especially critical for your digital projects. This means identifying and planning for potential risks as much as possible while also acknowledging that “We don’t know what we don’t know.”
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Such as:</strong>
        <br>
        What could go wrong during this project?
        <br>
        What could happen that would have an impact on our ability to deliver this solution, or might change the nature of the solution we’re hoping to provide?
        <br>
        Are there actions we can take now to prevent or lower the chances of running into the risks identified?
        <br>
        What is Plan B for each identified risk and is there enough contingency in the budget, timeline and scope planning to allow for the team to move to Plan B if we need to?
