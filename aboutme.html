        1.0 - About Me</p>
    <p>My name is Mark Eames as a Chestrian, I have lived all of my life in Chester. I’m married and have two young sons, both of whom like myself are keen Liverpool FC fans. I'm fortunate enough to have a season ticket, so I get to visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield" target="_blank">Anfield</a> regularly.
    <br>
    <br>
    I worked for <a href="https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/" target="_blank">Lloyds Banking Group</a> (LBG) for 30 years, my most recent role was a Senior Document Developer, responsible for working on the banks transactional paper & digital communications. Development was done in a tool called ‘Pitney Bowes Designer’ which is a software tool that allows the user to create a resource file that holds the conditional logic, which is then has data passed through it to create banks statements and various banking letters.
    <br>
    <br>
    For my career progression, the most logical step was to get involved in using JavaScript, HTML, CCS and similar type languages, all of which are new to me. I came across <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwu2TxteU6AIVibTtCh2aCQQeEAAYAiAAEgIKhvD_BwE" target="_blank">Code Nation</a> more by chance than anything else, I had spent some time trying to find a course that delivers exactly what this three week course does. I was very fortunate to get a spot on the course due to a last minute cancellation (fate I hope). The facilities and staff at the Chester office are both excellent and welcoming in equal degrees, and I am thoroughly enjoying the course and the content, in particular the xcode element. My aim is to secure a spot on the next 12 week course, fingers crossed.
