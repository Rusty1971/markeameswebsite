        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), have overhauled how businesses process and handle data. Europe is now covered by the world's strongest data protection rules. The mutually agreed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on May 25, 2018, and was designed to modernise laws that protect the personal information of individuals.
        GDPR applies across the entirety of Europe but each individual country has the ability to make its own small changes. In the UK, the government has created a new Data Protection Act (2018) which replaces the 1998 Data Protection Act.
        The new UK Data Protection Act was passed just before GDPR came into force, after spending several months in draft formats and passing its way through the House of Commons and House of Lords.
