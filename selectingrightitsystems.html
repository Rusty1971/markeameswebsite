        1.5 - Selecting the Right IT Systems</p>
    <p>
        Having a clear vision of what technology you want to use is crucial. First of all list the criteria for the project at hand such as:</p>
    <p class="tab">Size and type of the project and complexity of the tasks.
        <br>
        Development speed as well as cost and availability of IT experts.
        <br>
        Presence of development tools and ready-made solutions.
        <br>
        Project flexibility and scalability.
        <br>
        Technical requirements, existence of detailed documentation.
        <br>
        Support costs.</p>
        <p>Try to make recommendations for the direction of development based on the size and complexity of a given task. Try splitting projects into 3 groups:
        <br>
        <strong>Simple</strong> (business sites, landing pages, small online stores or applications)
        Such solutions are usually created with the help of CMS or ready-made templates.
        <br>
        <strong>Medium</strong> (complex online stores and marketplaces, national-scale portals, various SaaS, advanced applications) – such projects are usually built around frameworks.
        <br>
        <strong>Large</strong> (huge portals, social networks, innovative and non-trivial apps and integrated software systems) – the core of such projects is developed in a High Level programming language.
        <br>
        <br>
        In software development, there are 3 levels of programming abstraction:
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>High-Level Language (HLL) Coding</strong>
        <br>
        Programming in a high-level language (HLL), you can do anything – you’re limited only by time and budget. Pure coding permits the development of advanced programs with high functionality, traffic and security. All the largest programs in the world, including Amazon, YouTube, Tumblr and Facebook, are written in HLL. Creating your project from the ground up in HLL will demand more time in comparison to the integration of some ready components. In IT we count time as the hourly rate of a programmer multiplied by the hours needed for project realisation.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>A framework</strong>
        <br>
        A framework is a kind of functional block with predefined features. The framework speeds up development but imposes certain limitations. It often demands additional data (libraries) and puts strict restrictions on integration.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Content Management System (CMS)</strong>
        <br>
        Content Management System (CMS) is a ready-made solution. These typically have a massive number of restrictions on their functionality, flexibility and appearance. It is difficult and inefficient to go outside of the box, but you can develop simple sites with up to a million users per month. Most often, one level of abstraction is based on another. For each popular language, there are many different frameworks and CMS.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moreover, different technologies can co-exist within one large project. For example, one computing language is more suitable for team programming and another for encrypting – this is why different components of the solution use different languages. This is okay if it helps to solve business tasks more efficiently.
