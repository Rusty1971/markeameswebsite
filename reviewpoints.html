        Unit 1, Outcome 2</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>2.1 - Review Ongoing use of IT Tools</strong>
        <br>
        All tools were helpful in their own right, Trello allowed me to think ahead about what actions I wanted to
        complete, I could think about them and then break them down into bite size elements that we easier to
        concentrate on. It also allowed me to see how much more needed to be done, it was worth spending time up front
        to create the relevant cards.
        <br>
        Visual Studio Code was the tool used to create both the .html (Hypertext Markup Language) & .css (Cascading
        Style Sheet) files. These compliment each other very well, they were easy to use and use a similar style of
        syntax which was helpful when learning to use them for the first time. I can see spending more time developing
        the website, these tools would become easier to use and confidence to experiment more would happen naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2.2 - Were Selected IT Tools Appropriate</strong>
        <br>
        The tools were appropriate for the tasks that we were asked to do. I have never completed web development before
        so can’t really comment on better options for doing this. I have however used JIRA (a tool developed by
        Australian Company Atlassian. It is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management.) boards
        before which are similar to the Trello boards. In my opinion there are subtle differences in JIRA that I
        prefered to Trello. In JIRA I like that you can group your tasks (cards) into more meaningful groups like Epics
        and Stories and then a group of individual tasks related to the Story that then relates back to the relevant
        Epics. I understand why Trello was used, this is an excellent free online tool and does what is required for
        this course.

        <strong>2.3 - Strengths & Weaknesses of Final Project</strong>
        <br>
        My final project….. I’m not sure any personal project would reach a final stage as I’m sure there are different
        things that you would spot, either yourself or through feedback, that you’d like to change.
        <br>
        In my project I like that the webpages are all consistent and clear, this might not be everyone's prefered look,
        but is certainly an objective that I set out to achieve. The page links at the top, work as expected, as do the
        link buttons at the bottom to assist navigation through the site. I’m pleased with the colour coordination
        within the top Flexbox and the look of my action buttons at the bottom.
        <br>
        Things that did not go as well as expected and I would say are weakness, is the fact that I spent a reasonable
        amount of time trying to add images as backgrounds with page content sitting on top.Whilst I managed to get the
        image to show, I wasn’t able to show the page content (text) well enough that I wanted to progress and submit as
        my final project. In the end I bailed out on that, but it is something that if time is available, I would take
        another look at.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2.4 - Project Improvement</strong>
        <br>
        I am sure there are many aspects of my website that could be improved, as mentioned in my weaknesses above. One
        aspect that I am going to try and add in if time permits, is links to other websites. I have done this for
        references, however I think I could add these to some of the content within individual web pages, (e.g) in About
        Me, I mention that I’m a Liverpool supporter and that I visit Anfield regularly, I could make ‘Anfield’ a
        clickable link to a picture of Anfield. This could be reviewed throughout all pages and more hyperlinks added
        for various content. I will try to add some of these should time allow.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2.5 - Is Project Fit for Requirements</strong>
        <br>
        At the start we were given an extensive set of requirements for this project, which involved a lot of research
        into the purpose of IT, digital projects, using the right IT systems and risks that come with them to name a
        few. We researched technology constraints, what impact GDPR would have on our websites as well as disability
        considerations and what file types were best to use when we built our sites. All of this content provides the
        basis of the information held on my website.
        <br>
        Part of our Agile approach was to review and inspect what we had done, this was extremely helpful and really
        helped me identify issues, in particular on my back, forward and home buttons. They were already working prior
        to me, moving them into a Flexbox, however upon checking them the first couple of pages worked, but most didn’t.
        This allowed me to go into all of my .html files and correct the issues.
