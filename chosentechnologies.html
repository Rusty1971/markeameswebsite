        1.6 - Have Chosen Technologies Helped</p>

        Trello has helped me so far to get all of the given tasks required to be listed in a logical order which has been able to be prioritised. Some tasks are more important than others. This allows you to create in the order in which the tasks are required so long as you don’t procrastinate. When building the website as part of the coursework this will help me to create logical steps.

        Slack may not be used as much during this project, but will still be useful to communicate with Liam when required to get clarification.

        GitHub will become more crucial during this process, we have only used this twice to back up our JavaScript code so far. However when building the website, I presume this will get backed up at the end of each day, by pushing the code to GitHub, giving me an end of day back up, so should I lose code there will be a point to return too. At this point, I’m not sure on the number of files that will be pushed to GtHub, but if there are multiple files then comments in the (git.commit “version comments” push process will allow version control.
