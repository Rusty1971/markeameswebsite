        1.5 - Copyright Constraints</p>
    <p>
        Copyright refers to the legal protection of original works of authorship. This includes literary, written,
        dramatic, artistic, musical, and other types of creative expression.
        It does not include industrial or technological inventions, although there are jurisdiction’s that consider
        computer software a creative work capable of copyright.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes copyright protection overlaps with other types of intellectual property. For example, an online game
        may contain storylines and music appropriate for copyright registration, but also contains processes that need
        protection under patent law.
        <br>
        Websites contain written material, graphics, business logos, and other visual and sound elements. This firmly
        categorizes them as copyrightable material.
        <br>
        Copyright protection laws are similar around the world, with a few subtle differences. Here is an overview of
        the law in the UK.
        <br>
        <br>
        The law in the U.K. is the ‘Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988’. It is similar to the U.S. law in that it
        protects original creations involving literary work, music, art, film, and sound.
        <br>
        A supplemental law, the ‘Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992’ extends protection to software, which
        is normally protected under laws and agencies unique from copyright. Works are protected upon creation, meaning
        as soon as you post your website, you enjoy copyright protection. However, the U.K. Copyright Service highly
        recommends registration because websites are subject to abuse and that process allows a civil cause of action.
        The U.K. law does not extend the same copyright protection to logos as the U.S. law. You will have to register
        any logos as a trademark.
