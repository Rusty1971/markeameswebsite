        1.6 - Access Issues / Considerations</p>
    <p>
       Ideally, everyone should be able to use any website on the internet. It shouldn’t matter if they have a condition that affects their capabilities or what hardware and software they need to use. This is the main tenet behind the concept of web accessibility.
       <br>
       <br>
        The fact is that millions of internet users have special needs, disabilities, and impairments that can make it difficult or even impossible for them to use certain types of websites. By designing your site with these challenges in mind, you can ensure that it’s welcoming to as many users as possible. There are a many disabilities and conditions that can affect the way people use websites such as:
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Visual Impairment:</strong> This includes a partial or total inability to see or to perceive color contrasts.
        <br>
        <strong>Hearing Impairment:</strong> Some users have a reduced ability to hear.
        <br>
        <strong>Motor Skills/Physical Disabilities:</strong> Users may have difficulty moving parts of their bodies, including making precise movements (such as when using a mouse).
        <br>
        <strong>Photosensitive Seizures:</strong> Conditions such as epilepsy can cause seizures that are often triggered by flashing lights.
        <br>
        <strong>Cognitive Disabilities:</strong> There are also many conditions that affect cognitive ability, such as dementia and dyslexia.
        <br>
        <br>
        To work around these issues, many people use assistive technologies to browse the internet. This includes screen readers that vocalize the text on each page, speech recognition software that converts speech into text, Braille terminals, and even alternative keyboards that accommodate special needs.
        <br>
        As such, it’s possible for almost anybody to browse the web. What’s more, you can make their experiences significantly better by designing your site with accessibility in mind.
