        1.2 - Skills & Resources for Digital Projects</p>
    <p>
        Digital projects are different than traditional projects. Most techniques and frameworks taught at universities and business schools are too complex for teams working on digital projects (like building a website, making an app, or running a marketing campaign).
        Digital products are malleable by their nature: they’re easily changed, adjusted, and improved. That's why agile project management principles often work better for digital project management. I have in previous work roles used both the Waterfall (Prince2) and Agile (SCRUM) approaches. [1]
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Method</strong>
        <br>
        As already mentioned I have used a couple of methods in different roles, my prefered method is Aigle using the SCRUM process. I found this to be reactive to client feedback, using 3 week sprints, thye we able to inspect and review what we’d done so far and allowed for reactive changes rather than a vast raft of changes during testing, which really should just be for bug fixes. I do appreciate though that not all projects lend themselves to Agile, sometimes Waterfall suits better.

        <strong>Kanban Workflow Method</strong>
        <br>
        Trello is one of the best-known Kanban workflow project management tools available today (and what we used at <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwu2TxteU6AIVibTtCh2aCQQeEAAYAiAAEgIKhvD_BwE" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>), because it offers a free version, it’s often the go-to Kanban tool. However, when you need a little more oomph from your Kanban tools, such as the extra functionality or integrations that don’t come with Trello’s free version, you’re going to need to pay for those “Power-Ups”. Before you sign up for something that doesn’t quite serve your needs, it pays to look at alternatives to Trello. In a previous role I have used JIRA which is similar to Trello, but allows you to create Epics, which breakdown into Stories and Tasks, which I feel offers a better overview of the progression within the project [2]

        <strong>Skills Required</strong>
        <br>
        As well as the skills that we are looking to learn here at <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwu2TxteU6AIVibTtCh2aCQQeEAAYAiAAEgIKhvD_BwE" target="_blank">Code Nation</a> such as JarvaScript, Xcode, HTML & CSS, other skills to run alongside project methods and kanban workflow would be people skills (the ability to build relationships), analytical skills, collaboration skills and leaderships skills (ability to step in and take the lead).
