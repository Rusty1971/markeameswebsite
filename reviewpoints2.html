        Unit 1, Outcome 3</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>3.1 - Benefits & Drawbacks of IT Tools</strong>
        <br>
        It is hard to comment on the drawbacks from the IT tools as this is the first time that I’ve had exposure to all
        of the tools (Trello, Visual Studio & Xcode) that we’ve used. This is also the first time that I’ve used a Mac
        for any length of time so that in itself has been a learning experience in itself.
        <br>
        I found working as part of a team more enjoyable in particular the mob development approach to building our
        coffee application in Xcode. I found Xcode very intuitive to use, (and it was great to get an insight to how so
        of the apps that I use regularly could have been built). However I found that its use was limited because the
        three of us in the team could not develop at seperate machines, and then combine over work easily, hence why we
        used the mob approach.
        <br>
        Having used text editors before (Notepad++ & Textpad) in a previous role, I couldn’t see any drawbacks with
        Visual Studio Code, it even gave suggestions to the type of syntax you were trying to write, which I found
        really useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3.2 - Improve Productivity and Efficiency</strong>
        <br>
        When we worked as part of a group to create our coffee application, we got together and agreed to have daily
        stand ups. This allowed us to understand where we were up to, what we were doing next and brought up any issues
        within the group. This process made sure that we didn’t duplicate work or didn’t get stuck on something that
        someone within the team already knew how to resolve. An example of this was splitting the research of existing
        coffee applications between us, so we all didn’t go away and research Starbuck.
        <br>
        During the development of the coffee application, we were doing a mob development approach, so whilst one of the
        team was developing, the others were gathering images that we want to use in the application, or descriptions of
        what are coffee’s we like or even updating Trello cards to keep us on track.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3.3 - Improve Own Productivity in Digital Projects</strong>
        <br>
        It is important to use all of the same principles as in previous question ‘3.2 - Improve Productivity &
        Efficiency’, but where I think improvements could be made is in the use of Slack. I felt that this was not used
        to the fullest extent, partly because I didn’t always see the notifications pop up on the screen (possible
        limitation of Slack). I think using this more frequently would have helped improve productivity. I also think
        remembering to take breaks for a coffee and reflect on what you’ve been doing can help shape what you're going
        to do next, which I think in it’s own way helps you stay productive.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3.4 - Testing Digital Solutions</strong>
        <br>
        Testing digital solutions in my opinion, work better when doing them very regularly. During building my website,
        I have been constantly writing new elements of code in HTML, then refreshing it in chrome to view what the
        changes look like, which was quite simple while using HTML, but became more important when using CSS. There were
        many times I made changes in CSS which had no impact on my actual website (for example when I was trying to
        change the appearance of my navigation bar at the top of the page within flexbox).
        <br>
        So if you tried to do all development prior to any testing, then we’d be left with an application that doesn’t
        look like what you were expecting, and potentially a lot of fault fixing.

        top.
